<h1>Sophon SDK</h1>

**Sophon SDK** is an Apache-2.0, embeddable Rust SDK built from the published
Grok Build source tree. Its `sophon-sdk` crate gives trusted
desktop main processes explicit control over model providers, subagents,
auxiliary inference, image/video services, MCP transports, host filesystem and
terminal delegation, typed model-catalog discovery, sessions, replay, and
extensions without requiring Grok account login or ambient credentials.

This repository retains the upstream CLI/TUI source and provenance so SDK
consumers can audit the implementation. It is an independent redistribution;
it is not an official xAI SDK. See [`SOURCE_REV`](SOURCE_REV),
[`UPSTREAM_GROK_BUILD_COMMIT`](UPSTREAM_GROK_BUILD_COMMIT),
[`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES), and the SDK's
[capability and trust-boundary documentation](crates/sophon-sdk/README.md).

The upstream **Grok Build** application is SpaceXAI's terminal-based AI coding agent. It runs as a
full-screen TUI that understands your codebase, edits files, executes shell
commands, searches the web, and manages long-running tasks — interactively,
headlessly for scripting/CI, or embedded in editors via the Agent Client
Protocol (ACP).

This repository contains the Rust source for the `grok` CLI/TUI and its agent
runtime. It is synced periodically from the SpaceXAI monorepo.

A small `SOURCE_REV` file at the root records the full monorepo commit SHA
for the version of the code present in this tree.
`UPSTREAM_GROK_BUILD_COMMIT` records the corresponding public
`xai-org/grok-build` snapshot used by the SDK's automated upstream sync.

The synchronized public snapshot reports the upstream 1.0.10 source line at
commit `9684fa3cdbf2995e30ea8b9b637f1db008f144fc`, including the public source
syncs through 2026-08-27. Its embedded monorepo revision is
`70ec060ec3d28e77b9c4593be43c2ab0128bcd21`. Release labels are informative;
the commit and source-revision files are the authoritative identities. This
does not claim equivalence to a newer npm or prebuilt-binary release.

## Synchronized upstream baseline

This update advances the prior public pin
`19d42e35c07a9c9244f03f6df0c4c353f970d4f9` to
`9684fa3cdbf2995e30ea8b9b637f1db008f144fc`, covering the published 1.0.7,
1.0.8, 1.0.9, and 1.0.10 source changes plus the later August 25 and August 27
source syncs. The complete source delta is retained rather than selectively
backported.

Highlights relevant to embedders include:

- active follow-up messages to running subagents, with bounded admission and
  explicit accepted, rejected, and uncertain outcomes;
- segmented compaction as the native default, two-pass compaction enabled by
  default, and an explicit max-token length policy that remains fail-closed for
  normal SDK Turns;
- MCP form/URL elicitation, server-name-keyed configuration (so two names may
  share one URL), non-blocking connection startup, and newer rmcp 3.x transport
  behavior;
- centralized rustls client policy for OS/Mozilla trust roots and optional
  `GROK_EXTRA_CA_BUNDLE` / `SSL_CERT_FILE` roots;
- faster concurrent subagents, richer workflow controls, prompt stashing,
  worktree lifecycle improvements, and persistent dashboard workspace state;
- internal extraction of shared directory and terminal ownership into
  `xai-dirs` and `xai-grok-shell-terminal`.

The SDK-specific typed surfaces and trust-boundary details are documented in
[`crates/sophon-sdk/README.md`](crates/sophon-sdk/README.md).

## Installing the upstream binary

The upstream project publishes prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash   # macOS / Linux / Git Bash
irm https://x.ai/cli/install.ps1 | iex          # Windows PowerShell
grok --version
```

See the [changelog](https://x.ai/build/changelog) for the latest fixes,
features, and improvements in each release.

## Building from source

Requirements:

- **Rust** — the toolchain is pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml);
  `rustup` installs it automatically on first build.
- **[DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com)** — required so hermetic tools under
  [`bin/`](bin/) (notably [`bin/protoc`](bin/protoc)) can download and run.
  Install it and ensure `dotslash` is on your `PATH` **before** building:

  ```sh
  cargo install dotslash
  # or: prebuilt packages — https://dotslash-cli.com/docs/installation/
  /usr/bin/env dotslash --help   # sanity check
  ```

- **protoc** — proto codegen resolves [`bin/protoc`](bin/protoc) via DotSlash,
  or falls back to a `protoc` on `PATH` / `$PROTOC`.
- macOS and Linux are supported build hosts; Windows builds are best-effort
  and not currently tested from this tree.

```sh
cargo run -p xai-grok-pager-bin              # build + launch the TUI
cargo build -p xai-grok-pager-bin --release  # release binary: target/release/xai-grok-pager
cargo check -p xai-grok-pager-bin            # fast validation
```

The binary artifact is named `xai-grok-pager`; official installs ship it as
`grok`. On first launch it opens your browser to authenticate — see the
[authentication guide](crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/02-authentication.md).

## Documentation

Full online documentation is available at
[docs.x.ai/build/overview](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview).

The user guide ships with the pager crate:
[`crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/`](crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/)
— getting started, keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, configuration, theming,
MCP servers, skills, plugins, hooks, headless mode, sandboxing, and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Development

```sh
cargo check -p <crate>        # always target specific crates; full-workspace builds are slow
cargo test -p xai-grok-config # per-crate tests
cargo clippy -p <crate>       # lint config: clippy.toml at the repo root
cargo fmt --all               # rustfmt.toml at the repo root
```

## SDK release status

`sophon-sdk` is suitable for an Apache-2.0 public source repository and
pinned Git-tag consumption. It is not currently a crates.io-publishable
standalone crate: the runtime depends on the bundled workspace's local
`xai-grok-*` crate closure and workspace patches. See the SDK
[release-status documentation](crates/sophon-sdk/README.md#public-release-status)
before cutting a public version.

```toml
[dependencies]
sophon-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/fran0220/sophon-sdk", tag = "v0.3.0" }
```
